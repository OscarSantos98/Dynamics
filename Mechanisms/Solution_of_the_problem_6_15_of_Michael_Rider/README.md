The problem consist to determine the values for the angular velocities and angular accelerations shown in the image.

There are several ways to solve this problem, I decided to solve it using vector algebra and methods of dynamics of rigid bodies.
The problem was solved using **Python**, the only library that is required to run the program is *sympy*, which in my case was included when I installed python.

The solutions for this problem according to the program are included in the following table.

| Angular velocities *rad/s* | Value | Angular accelerations *rad/s^2* | Value |
|:--------------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| omega2 | 9 | alpha2 | 0 |
| omega3 | 2.09422879753408 | alpha3 | 0.282726957185647 |
| omega4 | 8.28285949170457 | alpha4 | -17.0777511678876 |
